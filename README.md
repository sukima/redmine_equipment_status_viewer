# Contributing

**I am not maintaining this.** I wrote this a long time ago and have no intention to continue working on it **all by myself.** What this means is I need **you** to contribute!

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

*Trust me on this!* I will hit that `merge` button so fast! Seriously, all you need to do is fork and edit the code. So send me *Pull Requests* please! On the flip side if I get just an issue asking for some feature or if this can be upgraded to the latest version of Redmine or Rails I will close it with the following reply:

> I can no longer maintain this code on my own. I need contributions to make any effort worth while. I no longer use this in my day to day work and have no intention to provide support all on my own. This project follows a very loose contribution process in that a simple pull request is all that is needed to be given commit access. If you want a feature or have it upgraded to the latest version of Redmine or Rails I ask that you make a Pull Request with that change so that others can also benefit.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. **External API changes and significant modifications** ought to be subject to an **internal pull-request** to solicit feedback from other contributors.
1. Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are *encouraged* for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.
1. Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style.

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.

## Changes to this arrangement

This is an experiment and feedback is welcome! This document may also be subject to pull-requests or changes by contributors where you believe you have something valuable to add or change.
